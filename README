PROJECT SUMMARY & FEATURES

This is a broswer based auto-sudoku solver. Upon opening the app, the user is presented with an empty sudoku grid and can
fill out any numbers in the grid as needed. Then, the sudoku grid is solved via a backtracking algorithm after hitting
the 'solve' button. Note that the algorithm will validate the user's input (which must be an integer between 1 and 9
inclusive). This algorithm is animated so that the user can see the live progress of the computer trying out different
possibilities.

Additionally, the numbers that the users input are highlighted in red while the numbers filled in by the computer are
displayed in black so that the user can keep track of which numbers were inputted manually. Upon completion of the algorithm,
a message is displayed depending on if the puzzle had a solution or not. Afterward, the user may hit the 'clear' button
to start over.


TIME SPENT: In total, developing the sudoku solving algorithm and the frontend took around 4 hours.

RUNNING THE PROJECT:

Open an IDE (e.g PyCharm, VSCode, etc) and clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/AC2005/SudokuSolver).

Then, make sure all the requirements are installed by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

Then, run main.py (either via the IDE terminal 'python main.py' or through the IDE)

Once running, the program will print out a URL to the console that will look something like this: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'

Click/paste the URL into a web browser and the app will open.
