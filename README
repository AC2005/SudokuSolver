PROJECT SUMMARY & FEATURES

This is a broswer based auto-sudoku solver. Upon opening the app, the user is presented with an empty sudoku grid and can
fill out any numbers in the grid as needed. Then, the sudoku grid is solved via a backtracking algorithm after hitting
the 'solve' button. Note that the algorithm will validate the user's input (which must be an integer between 1 and 9
inclusive). This algorithm is animated so that the user can see the live progress of the computer trying out different
possibilities.

Additionally, the numbers that the users input are highlighted in ___ while the numbers filled in by the computer are
displayed in __ so that the user can keep track of which numbers were inputted manually. Upon completion of the algorithm,
a message is displayed depending on if the puzzle had a solution or not. Afterward, the user may hit the 'clear' button
to start over.



TIME SPENT: In total, developing the sudoku solving algorithm and the frontend took around 4 hours.
